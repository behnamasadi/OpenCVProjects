    "# Perspective projection\n",
    "\n",
    "Perspective projection or perspective transformation is a linear projection where three dimensional objects are projected on a picture plane. This has the effect that distant objects appear smaller than nearer objects. Lines which are parallel in nature (that is, meet at the point at infinity) appear to intersect in the projected image. \n",
    "perspective transformation is change of view point. perspective preserve collinearity and incidence (straight lines will remain straight) but parallelism , length and angle may not preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "depending on the orientation of the projection plane towards the axes of the depicted object, perspective projection is categorized into **one-point**, **two-point** and **three-point** perspective.\n",

    "## One Point Perspective\n",
