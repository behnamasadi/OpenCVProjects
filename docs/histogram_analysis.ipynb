    "# Image contrast \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Image contrast refers to the difference in luminance or color that makes objects in an image distinguishable. In simpler terms, it's the difference between the lightest and darkest parts of an image. High contrast images have a larger difference between the darkest and lightest parts, whereas low contrast images have a smaller difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Luminance Contrast:** This refers to the difference in brightness levels. In a black and white image, high contrast means very dark blacks and very bright whites. Low contrast in such an image might appear more grayish, with the darks not being very dark and the whites not being very bright.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Color Contrast:** In color images, contrast can also refer to the difference in colors. For example, a red object against a green background has a high color contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too High:** If the contrast is too high, you can lose details. Bright areas might become overexposed, and dark areas underexposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too Low:** A very low contrast can make the image look washed out and details can become muddled.\n",

    "linearly rescaling the intensity levels to span the entire possible range. For example, in an 8-bit grayscale image, the intent is to stretch the current range of pixel values so that they span from 0 to 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:** Identify the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) pixel values in the original image.\n",
    "Linearly remap the original range [min, max] to the desired range, typically [0, 255] for an 8-bit image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:** Particularly useful for images that have pixel values in a limited range due to issues like underexposure or overexposure. By stretching this range, the contrast of the image is improved.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this is that a single outlying pixel with either a very high or very low value can severely affect the value of `Min` or `Max` and this could lead to very unrepresentative scaling. Therefore a more robust approach is to first take a histogram of the image, and then select `Min` and `Max` at, say, the `5th` and `95th` percentile in the histogram (that is, 5% of the pixel in the histogram will have values lower than `Min`, and 5% of the pixels will have values higher than `Max`). This prevents outliers affecting the scaling so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common technique for dealing with outliers is to use the intensity histogram to find the most popular intensity level in an image (i.e. the histogram peak) and then define a cutoff fraction which is the minimum fraction of this peak magnitude below which data will be ignored. The intensity histogram is then scanned upward from 0 until the first intensity value with contents above the cutoff fraction. This defines `Min`. Similarly, the intensity histogram is then scanned downward from 255 until the first intensity value with contents above the cutoff fraction. This defines `Max`.\n",

    "Creating new image which has new uniform distribution. The primary idea behind **HE** is to adjust the intensity values of an image such that they're uniformly distributed across the entire range. **HE** works well for images where the subject and background are both underexposed or overexposed. But for images with varying brightness levels, applying HE can over-amplify the contrast in some regions, making details hard to discern.\n",

    "# Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE):\n",
    "To counter the issues of standard HE, AHE was introduced.\n",
    "Instead of applying HE on the whole image, AHE divides the image into smaller, non-overlapping regions or tiles. HE is then applied to each of these small tiles.\n",
    "This approach ensures that the equalization is adaptive and local, taking into consideration only the data in that tile. Thus, it can bring out details in regions with different brightness levels.\n",
    "However, AHE has a drawback: If there's noise in the image, it can get amplified in the tiles, since noise can produce local intensity peaks.\n",

    "# Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) \n",
    "Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is an advanced method for improving the contrast of images. It's an extension of the standard histogram equalization (HE) method, which aims to enhance image contrast by redistributing the intensities of pixels. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of CLAHE:\n",

    "2. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE):\n",

    "CLAHE is an improvement over AHE.\n",
    "The main difference is that in CLAHE, the histogram equalization is applied with a contrast limit. If any histogram bin is above this specified limit, the excess is clipped off and distributed among other bins.\n",
    "This contrast limiting reduces the amplification of noise in the image.\n",
    "After the contrast-limiting step, the neighboring tiles are combined using bilinear interpolation to remove any artificially induced boundaries, making the enhancement smooth.\n",
