    "#  Parallax\n",
    "\n",
    "The apparent position of an object changes differently depending on our distance from it. This is called  parallax. \n",
    "Parallax is simply the different amount of change in the apparent position of the object, which depends on how far we are from it.\n",
    "the objects in the distance appear to move more slowly than the objects close to the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenCV, \"parallax\" typically refers to the relative displacement of points in an image when viewed from two different perspectives, such as in stereo vision or structure-from-motion scenarios. Parallax is an essential concept in 3D computer vision, as it provides depth information. Here's an overview of how parallax is handled and calculated in OpenCV:\n",

    "### **1. Parallax in Stereo Vision**\n",
    "In stereo vision, the parallax (disparity) is the difference in the position of corresponding points in the left and right images. Disparity is used to calculate depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps to Compute Parallax (Disparity Map) in OpenCV**\n",
    "1. **Calibrate Cameras**:\n",
    "   Use `cv2.calibrateCamera()` to obtain camera matrices and distortion coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rectify Images**:\n",
    "   Use `cv2.stereoRectify()` to align the stereo image pair so that the epipolar lines are horizontal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Disparity Map**:\n",
    "   Use stereo matching algorithms like:\n",
    "   - `cv2.StereoBM_create()`: Block Matching algorithm.\n",
    "   - `cv2.StereoSGBM_create()`: Semi-Global Block Matching algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cv2\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load stereo images\n",
    "left_img = cv2.imread(\"left_image.png\", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\n",
    "right_img = cv2.imread(\"right_image.png\", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create StereoBM object and compute disparity\n",
    "stereo = cv2.StereoBM_create(numDisparities=16, blockSize=15)\n",
    "disparity = stereo.compute(left_img, right_img)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normalize the disparity map for visualization\n",
    "disp_vis = cv2.normalize(disparity, None, alpha=0, beta=255, norm_type=cv2.NORM_MINMAX)\n",
    "disp_vis = np.uint8(disp_vis)\n",
    "\n",
    "cv2.imshow(\"Disparity Map\", disp_vis)\n",
    "cv2.waitKey(0)\n",
    "cv2.destroyAllWindows()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Depth**:\n",
    "   Depth can be computed using the disparity map with the formula:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\text{Depth} = \\frac{f \\cdot B}{\\text{Disparity}}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - \\(f\\) = focal length of the camera.\n",
    "   - \\(B\\) = baseline (distance between the two cameras).\n",
    "   - Disparity = difference in pixel positions between the two images.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Parallax in Structure-from-Motion**\n",
    "In structure-from-motion (SfM), parallax is used to infer the 3D structure of a scene from multiple 2D images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Steps**:\n",
    "1. **Detect and Match Features**:\n",
    "   Use feature detection and matching algorithms (e.g., SIFT, ORB) to identify corresponding points in multiple images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Estimate Essential/Fundamental Matrix**:\n",
    "   Use `cv2.findEssentialMat()` or `cv2.findFundamentalMat()` to establish the relationship between points in two views.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recover Pose**:\n",
    "   Use `cv2.recoverPose()` to compute the camera's relative position and orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Triangulate Points**:\n",
    "   Use `cv2.triangulatePoints()` to compute 3D points from the matched 2D points.\n",
