    "* **Threshold selection:** gather a few dozen “sharp” and “blurry” samples, compute scores, plot their distributions, and choose T (e.g., a value between the clusters or using the 5–10th percentile of the sharp class as a cutoff). Resolution, noise, and content affect absolute values.\n",
    "* **Noise & compression:** strong noise or JPEG block artifacts can inflate the score. A light pre-blur (e.g., bilateral or Gaussian σ=0.5–1.0) can stabilize results.\n",
    "* **Scale/bit depth:** scores grow with intensity scale and scene texture. Keep preprocessing consistent (bit depth, contrast). If you must compare across different exposures/bit-depths, normalize:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Divide the Laplacian by 255 (8-bit) or 65535 (16-bit) before variance, **or**\n",
    "  * Use a **normalized focus measure**, e.g. `var(Lap) / mean(gray)^2`.\n",
    "* **Avoid borders:** derivatives are sensitive at borders. You can crop a small border (e.g., 8–16 px) before computing.\n",
    "* **ROI-based:** if only a region matters (e.g., subject center), compute on that ROI to avoid background bias.\n",
    "* **Multi-scale option:** take max/mean of variance computed with ksize 1,3,5 (helps when blur varies).\n",
    "* **Alternatives:** Tenengrad (variance/energy of Sobel magnitude), Sum Modified Laplacian (SML), or frequency-domain measures (high-frequency energy).\n",

    "# A tiny helper to auto-pick T (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pick_threshold(sharp_scores, blur_scores):\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    # Simple heuristic: midpoint of medians\n",
    "    return 0.5 * (np.median(sharp_scores) + np.median(blur_scores))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s it: compute Laplacian → variance → compare to a tuned threshold. It’s simple, fast, and works well as a first-pass blur detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Do we need a Gaussian first?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not required.**\n",
    "  The basic Laplacian variance method just applies the Laplacian to the grayscale image.\n",
    "* **But often useful.**\n",
    "  Real images have noise. Noise produces sharp pixel-to-pixel jumps → Laplacian will treat them as edges → variance gets inflated.\n",
    "  A small Gaussian blur (`σ ≈ 1.0`, `ksize=3`) smooths noise while keeping meaningful edges.\n",
    "  This is why “Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)” is also common in vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: Gaussian = optional pre-step for robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How do we calculate the Laplacian?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, with **convolution kernels** (second derivatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuous Laplacian of an image $I(x,y)$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 I = \\frac{\\partial^2 I}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 I}{\\partial y^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In discrete form (on a pixel grid), OpenCV approximates this by convolving with kernels.\n",
    "A common 3×3 kernel is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "1 & -4 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or the 8-neighbor version:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & -8 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 1 & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both approximate the Laplacian operator (just scaled differently).\n",
    "* OpenCV’s `cv::Laplacian` internally uses `cv::Sobel` to compute 2nd derivatives and adds them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So mathematically, the Laplacian image is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(i,j) = \\sum_{u,v} K(u,v) \\cdot I(i+u, j+v)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is the Laplacian kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. How do we calculate the variance of the Laplacian?\n",
    "\n",
    "Right: the Laplacian image $L$ is just a matrix of values (positive and negative).\n",
    "Variance is a **statistical measure of spread**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Var}(L) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(L_i - \\mu \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "* $N$ = number of pixels\n",
    "* $L_i$ = Laplacian value at pixel $i$\n",
    "* $\\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i L_i$ is the mean Laplacian value\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what `numpy.var` or OpenCV’s `meanStdDev` does.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lap = cv2.Laplacian(gray, cv2.CV_64F)\n",
    "score = lap.var()   # variance of all pixels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Optional) Gaussian blur to suppress noise.\n",
    "2. Apply Laplacian → convolution with kernels (OpenCV does it internally).\n",
    "3. Compute variance of all pixel values in Laplacian image → a single scalar score.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sharp image** → edges strong → Laplacian values large and diverse → **high variance**\n",
    "* **Blurred image** → edges smoothed → Laplacian values close to zero → **low variance**\n",
