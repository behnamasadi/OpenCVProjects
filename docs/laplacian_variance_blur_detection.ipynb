    "* **Not required.**\n",
    "  The basic Laplacian variance method just applies the Laplacian to the grayscale image.\n",
    "* **But often useful.**\n",
    "  Real images have noise. Noise produces sharp pixel-to-pixel jumps ‚Üí Laplacian will treat them as edges ‚Üí variance gets inflated.\n",
    "  A small Gaussian blur (`œÉ ‚âà 1.0`, `ksize=3`) smooths noise while keeping meaningful edges.\n",
    "  This is why ‚ÄúLaplacian of Gaussian (LoG)‚Äù is also common in vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: Gaussian = optional pre-step for robustness.\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, with **convolution kernels** (second derivatives).\n",

    "The continuous Laplacian of an image $I(x,y)$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 I = \\frac{\\partial^2 I}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 I}{\\partial y^2}\n",

    "* Both approximate the Laplacian operator (just scaled differently).\n",
    "* OpenCV‚Äôs `cv::Laplacian` internally uses `cv::Sobel` to compute 2nd derivatives and adds them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So mathematically, the Laplacian image is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(i,j) = \\sum_{u,v} K(u,v) \\cdot I(i+u, j+v)\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. How do we calculate the variance of the Laplacian?\n",
    "\n",
    "Right: the Laplacian image $L$ is just a matrix of values (positive and negative).\n",
    "Variance is a **statistical measure of spread**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Var}(L) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(L_i - \\mu \\right)^2\n",
